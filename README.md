Crypto Trading System
=====================

This repository contains the core components of a high-performance, event-driven crypto trading system. Designed with a focus on low-latency and robust data processing, the system connects to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, executes trading strategies, and manages orders with built-in risk checks.

Project Overview
----------------

The system is engineered to handle real-time market data from multiple exchanges simultaneously. It uses a multi-threaded architecture with pinned threads to minimize context switching and maximize processing speed. Market data is consumed, normalized, and published to a central event bus, where various trading strategies can subscribe and react in real-time. Orders generated by these strategies are passed to an Order Management System (OMS) for pre-trade risk checks before being sent to the respective exchanges. All market data, events, and trade actions are logged and persisted for backtesting and analysis.

Key Features
------------

*   **Low-Latency Market Data Processing:** Utilizes efficient data structures like SPSC queues and a fast JSON parser to handle high-volume market feeds.
    
*   **Modular Architecture:** The event-bus design allows for easy integration of new exchanges, data parsers, and trading strategies without affecting the core system.
    
*   **Multi-Exchange Connectivity:** Integrates with major cryptocurrency exchanges for diverse market access.
    
*   **Robust Order Management:** The OMS provides a critical layer for managing orders and enforcing risk parameters.
    
*   **Persistent Data Storage:** Market data and trading events are stored for historical analysis, performance evaluation, and backtesting purposes.
    

Architecture
------------

The system's architecture is centered around a high-speed **Event Bus** that acts as the central nervous system.

1.  **Market Feeds:** Real-time market data is ingested from connected exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase, Kraken). Each feed is handled by a dedicated thread pinned for performance.
    
2.  **Data Parsers:** Raw data from each feed is passed to a dedicated parser via an **SPSC Queue**. The parser normalizes the data into a common format before publishing it to the Event Bus.
    
3.  **Event Bus:** This central component distributes the normalized market events to all subscribed components, such as trading strategies.
    
4.  **Trading Strategies:** Multiple strategies can run concurrently, subscribing to market events and generating trading signals.
    
5.  **Order Management System (OMS):** All orders from trading strategies are routed through the OMS. It performs essential risk checks (e.g., position limits, leverage) before placing the order.
    
6.  **Logger & DB:** Critical data points—including market events, strategy signals, and order actions—are logged and stored in a database for persistence and post-trade analysis.
    
7.  **Exchanges:** The OMS places approved orders on the target exchanges.
    

Tech Stack
----------

*   **Core Language:** C++ for its performance and low-level control.
    
*   **Networking:** boost::asio is used for high-performance, asynchronous networking to handle exchange connections.
    
*   **Data Structures:** A custom SPSC (Single-Producer, Single-Consumer) Queue is implemented for lock-free, high-speed inter-thread communication.
    
*   **JSON Parsing:** simdjson is used for ultra-fast, SIMD-accelerated JSON parsing of market data feeds.
    
*   **Persistent Storage:** QuestDB is used as a high-performance time-series database for efficient storage and querying of market and trade data.
